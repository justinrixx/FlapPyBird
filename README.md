Flappy Bird Plays Itself
===============

This is a fork of a [flappy bird clone](https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird).
The game uses QLearning to learn how to play the game. I am not the first person to do this. I got the idea
from [this guy](https://sarvagyavaish.github.io/FlappyBirdRL/).

How-to
------

1. Install Python 2.7.X or 3.5.x from [here](https://www.python.org/download/releases/)

2. Install PyGame 1.9.X from [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)

3. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/justinrixx/FlapPyBird.git` or click `Download ZIP` in right panel and extract it.

4. Run `python flappy.py` from the repo's directory

5. You can't play the game. It plays itself.

  (Note: Install pyGame for same version python as above)
